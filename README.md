# Coffee Sales Analysis

This coffee sales analysis file comprises several sheets: orders, customers, products, pivot table analysis, and dashboard.
The primary sheet, 'orders', has been populated with essential data drawn from the 'customers' and 'products' sheets 
using XLOOKUP, VLOOKUP,and dynamic INDEX-MATCH functions. Subsequently, I formatted the data, adjusting fields such as order date, size, and quantity.
I also expanded abbreviated coffee types and roast types to their full names and applied an IF statement to the email column data. 
My analysis, utilizing pivot tables, charts, and slicers, provides insights derived from the coffee sales data, centering on three pivotal tables.

## Insights With Slicers: montlhy order date as timline and coffee roast type as slicer 
- Using a monthly timeline as a slicer has not changed the fact that the United States (U.S.) is the most coffee-consuming country.
   However, I have observed a shift in the preference for coffee types by month. This could be due to seasonal preferences in coffee types.

- Among coffee roast types, lightly roasted coffee seems to be more popular in the summer season,
  but throughout the year, its popularity is fairly even, similar to the distribution among different coffee types.
